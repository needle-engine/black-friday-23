Get 30% OFF until 27th using [`BLACKFRIDAY23`](https://buy.stripe.com/7sIdThdwq4Og46I002?prefilled_promo_code=BLACKFRIDAY23) on checkout on all Needle Engine licenses ðŸ˜Š

## Made with Blender and Needle Add-On

The entire project has been made in Blender in a few hours, including the HTML parts.  
Quick iteration with Needle meant that lighting and reflections could be adjusted exactly as the user will see it in the browser, 
making a play with reflectiveness possible that would otherwise be hard to replicate over multiple pipeline steps.  

The project is live here:
